## Security Guidelines

### API Keys and Tokens
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your bot token and API keys private
- Regularly rotate your API keys and tokens
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### Best Practices
- Always use `.env.example` as a template, never with real credentials
- Check your git history to ensure no tokens were accidentally committed
- If you suspect your tokens are compromised, regenerate them immediately
- Keep your dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities

### Setting Up Securely
1. Create a new Discord application and bot token for each deployment
2. Use separate Spotify API credentials for development and production
3. Set up proper Discord bot permissions - only request what you need
4. Monitor your bot's usage for any suspicious activity
